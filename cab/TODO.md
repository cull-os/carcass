# Islands

```cab
<self:{ revision = "xxxxx" }:/sub/path>/non/locked/path
# ^^^ ^^^^^^^^ configuration  ^ subpath ^ outer path
# format
```

The format is the underlying island implementation here; `self` is the "current git repository", or whatever. Can be git, jj, fossil, whatever.

The subpath is the path that we nagivate to *before* locking. The hash/lock depends on the contents in that path.

Once we get the island and force any path within it, we hash it all. Outer path accesses do not influence the island lock.

We can also omit the configuration and inner path, like so:

```cab
<self>
```

Provide only a configuration:

```cab
<self:{ revision = "xxxxx" }>
```

Provide only a subpath:

```cab
<self::/sub/path>
```

`self` doesn't have any locking, as it is the current git repository anyway. So that expression above is pointless.

But this is not:

```cab
<fs::/home/foo>
```

That will only lock the `foo` home directory. While this (bad) would lock the whole of `/home`:

```cab
<fs::/home>/foo
```

Parsing this syntax is straightforward, you parse a stringlike that starts with `<` and ends with `:` or `>` for the format,
if the ending was `:`, parse an expression (perhaps `Noder::node_expression_single`, or a binding power one that doesn't consume the cons operator),
if the next is a `:` parse the `:` and another expression for a subpath, and then parse the `>`.

After parsing, feed all these (format (content): `Option<Thunk>`, config: `Option<Thunk>` and subpath: `Option<Thunk>`) into an Island thunk,
and when forced, force the format, pick the island implementation off of that (perhaps this could be in `cab-island`, as a perfect hashmap for a `&str`)
and have it error depending on the arguments & if not return us our Island.

## Locking

This is tricky. We might want to lock depending on where the island literal was declared (as in files), but then we would lose the flexibility of having
lambdas that return islands by formatting. Maybe we want that tradeoff? Or we could make the user explicitly pin islands in the place they want, but that
requires more care and will make the language clunky. I believe we should pick the "lock to source.lock.cab" approach where source is from the literal.

For the entrypoint which is stdin, we will make an exception and make it not lock anything at all. Maybe we should generalize this to all leafs which don't have parents?
But that is a bad idea, you can't get a sister of `<fs::/path/to/foo.cab>` as there is no parent, which might be unexpected behaviour. Maybe we should store it inline?
Like in the file itself, modify the island directly in source code for locking.

That is a perfect idea and every island will be required to output itself with a fully locked (ie. non-loose) version. Then we can format it and replace it in the source code.

For this I will need to work on:

1. An evaluator.
2. A formatter.
3. The island stuff, finally.

Let's get to work (and read a few STG papers & the Tvix codebase).
