## License Grants and Conditions

### Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
license:

1. Under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
   Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify,
   display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either
   on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work.
2. Under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale,
   have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its
   Contributor Version.

### Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section `Grants` with respect to any Contribution become
effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
such Contribution.

### Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section `License Grants and Conditions` are the
only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be
implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this
License. Notwithstanding Section `Grants(2)` above, no patent license is granted
by a Contributor:

- For any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or
- For infringements caused by:
  - Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software; or
  - the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of
    its Contributor Version); or
- Under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
  Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice
requirements in Section `Notices`).

### Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are
its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its
Contributions conveyed by this License.

### Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

### Conditions

Sections under `Responsibilities` are conditions of the licenses granted in
Section `Grants`.

You may also choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such
Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You
offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of
liability specific to any jurisdiction.

## Responsibilities

### Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Form, including any Modifications
that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this
License. You must inform recipients that the Source Form of the Covered Software
is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this
License. You must not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the
Source Form.

### Distribution of Secondary Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Secondary Form then:

- Such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Form, as described
  in Section `Distribution of Source Form`, and You must inform recipients of
  the Secondary Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Form by
  reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of
  distribution to the recipient.
- You must distribute such Secondary Form under the terms of this License.

### Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided
that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered
Software.

### Notices

You must not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of
liability) contained within the Source Form of the Covered Software.

## Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with
respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order,
or regulation then You must:

- Comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and
- Describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be
  placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software
  under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
  such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
  skill to be able to understand it.

## Termination

The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail
to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the
rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated:

- Provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally
  terminates Your grants; and
- On an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
  non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come
  back into compliance.

Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing
basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable
means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with
this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days
after Your receipt of the notice.

If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement
claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims)
alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent,
then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered
Software under Section `Grants` of this License shall terminate.

In the event of termination under Section `Termination`, all end user license
agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly
granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination
shall survive termination.

## Disclaimer of Warranty

Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without
warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as
to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any
Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor)
assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This
disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of
any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this
disclaimer.

## Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the
possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to
liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to
the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not
allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so
this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

## Litigation

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and
such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

## Miscellaneous

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against
a Contributor.

## Editions of the License

Any person or entity may create, modify, and publish new editions of this
License. Each edition must clearly distinguish itself from all previous editions
by a unique and self-identifying hash.

You may only distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the edition of
the License under which You originally received the Covered Software.

## Exhibit A - License Notice

```

The edition specified in the notice must correspond to the first 16 characters
of the SHA-256 digest of the license text, wherein the hash value within the
notice itself is substituted with the literal string "HASH-PLACEHOLDER"; failure
to satisfy this condition shall render the notice invalid.

You may also add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.
